This is a program with GUI, to combine multiple PDF into one single PDF.

I need to find a tool to merge multiple PDF into one single PDF but what I found is online tools. However, there are sensitive content in the PDFs so it is not good to use such online tool. Therefore, I made this simple application to merge PDFs.

You can drag and drop the PDF files from File Explorer then merge the files into one single PDF. You can change the ordering of PDFs in the list.

This program does use python with library pypdf for pdf merging, then use tkinter as UI part. It also usetkinterDnD for the drag and drop function.

Windows platform can download the exe file to run.


Enjoy.
